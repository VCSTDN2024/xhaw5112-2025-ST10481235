Development Process
Tools Used

React Native (Expo) – for cross-platform app development

TypeScript – for type-safe and maintainable code

React Navigation – for handling screen transitions

Visual Studio Code – used as the main code editor

GitHub – for version control and collaboration

The design followed a User-Centered Design (UCD) methodology. Wireframes and visual components were created based on student feedback to ensure accessibility and usability.
The design principles focused on:

Simplicity and ease of navigation

Consistent typography and color use

Accessibility and clarity for all user types

Development Stages

Planning: Defined project scope, structure, and dependencies

Design: Created layout prototypes and UI assets

Implementation: Developed the React Native app and integrated navigation

Testing: Tested app functionality and navigation using Expo

Deployment: Published and shared the final version on GitHub
